<p style="text-align: justify;">The guide told us to turn our camera into selfie mode. May be he wanted at least one pic with him in the frame-as a memory! I did as told. Then he took us to a spot and told us to click a selfie and surprised we were! We were looking into the screen in a way that the roof of the monument too was there. what an awe-inspiring site it was! a dome like architecture with a beautiful pattern ,which enabled sunlight to sieve through- was the roof of the royal Hammam where Noorjahan<span class="textexposedshow">Â is believed to have taken shower while her stay there in 1617. And this was just a tiny gem in the beautifully carved jewel of the medieval history of #Mandu in #Madhya Pradesh. The Hammam was a part of #Jahaz Mahal which was made to accomodate 15000 women which constituted the harem of Ghiyas-ud-din Khilji. Supposedly he was inspired by the Hindu God Krishna!</span>
<span class="textexposedshow">A quaint, sleepy , tiny hamlet amidst the Malwa plateau - Mandu fort-though not far from Indore- doesn't see much tourists and that perhaps is the reason that it's still clean and green.</span>
<span class="textexposedshow">The architecture of Jahaz Mahal which was named thus because it was surrounded by beautiful lakes on the three sides , giving the occupants of the palace the feel of a ship in the water-is a beautiful amalgamation of Afghan, Hindu, Mughal and even Roman styles. And of course the sound system too seemed far ahead of its time.</span>
<span class="textexposedshow">Mandu stands tall in the world of romance. Rani Roopmati Pavilion stands as a testimony to that. Baz Bahadur and Rani Roopmati's story is perhaps one of the oldest love stories.</span>
<span class="textexposedshow">Today Mandu can at best be called a ruined, uninhabited ,ancient city. Still it's a place where history seems to be beckoning from close-very close proximity...the kinds which I have not experienced anywhere else. You can close your eyes and feel the swish of the expensive clothes, can hear the jingle of the bracelets and smell the fragrances metaphorically!</span>
<span class="textexposedshow">A rendezvous with our own history-could there be a better way to rejuvenate the soul , to break free from the mundane!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a perimeter of 82 kms, Mandu fort is the biggest fort of India and the pieces of medieval history are strewn all around in the form of temples, mosques, palaces, pavilions. I wouldn't be exaggerating if i call it our own 'Machu Picchu' - rather better than that. Only thing- we just do not care because its not 'foreign'!</p>
