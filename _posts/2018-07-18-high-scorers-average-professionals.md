<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">Has been sometime since the board results were announced! Around two lakh students secured more than 90 percent in 10th and about a lakh secured more than 90 percent in 12th!!! And so many more of them in 80-90 percent bracket .So far so good. I should have been happy! Instead I was thinking- are these children all really as good as their marks suggest or is it also to do with something like 'inflation of marks' !!!!!!! Talking to the teaching fraternity in an informal set up and listening to academicians make you see how our education system works. ' Study NCERT books' , 'learn the key words and use them in your answers and you will score good' are some usual advices given to the students- with the idea of fetching more n more marks , firmly in place!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">Really! Whatever happened to divergent approach and thinking ! Children are not allowed to imagine , to think freely , creatively ! What kind of generation are we preparing !</span>
<span style="color: navy;">Ideally the children in the 90-100 percent bracket, should have gotten into their preferred colleges or fields without much glitch ( especially for students who appeared for JEE and NEET) but then that wasn't the case . Apparently there is huge gap between how u score in boards and how u should prepare for competitive exams ( this shall require another page)</span>
<span style="color: navy;">Dear #MrPrimeMinister, #NarendraModiji I remember you addressing the children prior to board exam and telling them not to get stressed! Did you really think that the stress is because of their boards! No, the stress is not because of the board exam, ( board has shown them the way to score using ' key words' , pun intended)The stress that our youth feels is because of the lack of true knowledge, lack of quality higher education institutes ,lack of employment avenues and most importantly lack of equal opportunities. You evade the question of reservation and its psychological effect on the children.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">With this kind of approach, can we really nurture the mind to innovate , to come out with 'out of the box' thinking ! I doubt.</span>
<span style="color: navy;">As the mother of a teen age son I am worried. As the citizen of this country I am worried.</span></p>
