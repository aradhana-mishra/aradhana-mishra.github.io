<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Someone asked her ‘so where do you belong to’ and she looked puzzled,</strong><br /><strong>For the entire country was her home and she belonged to the whole of it.</strong><br /><strong>To the place she was born at- in the Military Hospital, where her dad was pursuing a course.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><strong>To the High mountains, he called field posting, which she visited occasionally</strong><br /><strong>during her school vacations and played in the fresh snow with much delight.</strong><br /><strong>She feasted on the ripe apricots and enjoyed butter tea sitting by the Bukhari.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><strong>She belonged to the far east, where she made friends with the first sunlight of the country.</strong><br /><strong>She spoke to the sparkling waters of the mighty Brahmaputra and river Lohit became her pal,</strong><br /><strong>The expansive tea gardens never had enough of her and always asked more of her.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><strong>She also belonged to the south, where she made lots of friends on her dad’s peace posting.</strong><br /><strong>And to the colourful West where her mom had chosen to live while her dad served in field locations.</strong><br /><strong>‘oh!! An army kid then you must be’, said the guy, for they are the ones who belong to everywhere and to nowhere.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>They flow like water and waft in the air like the sweet spring fragrance,</strong><br /><strong>They take in the culture of every place they go to, and call it their home till dad gets his new posting,</strong><br /><strong>And with that they move again- To adapt to a new culture and to call it home.</strong><br /><br /><strong>
