<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">What shall be a perfect day for you ,</span>
<span style="color: #800000;">Asked a curious voice,with the gleaming eyes,</span>
<span style="color: #800000;">I pondered over-for me, a day is perfect so much more in the mind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">When it unfolds like that beautifully composed notes of a sweet sonnet,<span class="text_exposed_show">
When you love thyself with heart and mind both entwined.</span></span></p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">When your steps make a dialogue with the earth underneath,</span>
<span style="color: #800000;">And the rhythm of the heart resonates with the message of the day- about to unwind.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800000;">A day is perfect when you fill the home with laughter and warmth,</span>
<span style="color: #800000;">When your loved ones are much closer even when they are away- to him I opined!</span></p>
