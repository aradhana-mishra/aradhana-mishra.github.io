&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">The nip in the morning and the rays falling askance on the window pane,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Remind her, winter was on its way- in the plain and in the mountain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">“Finally! Over is the excruciating summer!!,” she sighed,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">A smile sprouted off her shapely mouth, but thereon defied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">For her soldier was up in the mountains, in the vigil of his land,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Soon, it will be white all around there, a vista -majestic and grand!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Soon, it will be cold with the rivers frozen and the trees bare,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">But alert he will have to be, his duty for his country- that’s all he would care.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">“well, I shall stitch a quilt for my soldier, to keep him warm,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">With appliques of affection, courage, belief and a bit of my charm,”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">She thought, her world had the colours in the smile of her child,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">While he stood guard, on that snowy peak, in the silent night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Maybe, she shall pack some childhood of their son too and send it there,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Lest it’s eaten by the termites of the time- to him that shall be unfair.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">She, her soldier’s eve, shall wait with as much fortitude and grit, if not more,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Till he comes home, let her heart wait and let her heart soar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">There will be dawn of the peace when the ‘winter’ of unrest is over,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">He then, shall be back with pride in his heart, and unmistakable composure.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">To the aroma of that chocolate cake being baked, to the hee-haw of his child,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">And to the smell of freshly cut lawn- in his absence gone wild.</span></p>
