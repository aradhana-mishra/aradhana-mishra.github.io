<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">There has been a lot of buzz about the movie #'Sanju'. While #Ranbir needed a 'hit' desperately , the real Sanju too, perhaps was looking for something that could establish the fact that he was a 'victim'. With Vidhu Vinod Chopra's cinematic genius thrown in, all party seemed to have achieved what they had set out for! Vidhu surely had a double laugh- one , he had fastened the 'friendship' belt a bit more securely and second , the earnings! what did the movie goers get? okay..lets be fair...at least they got to see the acting prowess of two amazing actors, Ranbir Kapoor and #Vicky Kaushal ( am I the only one to feel that Vicky Kaushal outdid Ranbir in the movie!)  , if not the 'biopic' in its true form!  Vidhu  Vinod Chopra was more a friend than a director for this particular movie. How conveniently the media was blamed for everything wrong in Sanjay Dutt's life!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">Funnier still, were the comments on different social networking sites, tagging the movie, as to how harshly Sanjay Dutt had been judged -all because of the faulty media!!! Really!! Some of them taking it a bit further by relating their own self with the 'book title' that Anushka Sharma's character had written on Sanjay Dutt's life in the movie. They lamented..."so true, kuch toh log kahenge". All through this, I was contemplating to deactivate my FB account!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">Vidhu Vinod Chopra had got the 'trophy' finally to his friend. Afterall, Bollywood is this one big happy family. Coming to this, off late, this really looks like the case. Movies are made for friends children. And their children too have started claiming their share of limelight. Alright, Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not the only one to blame the media apparently. I too blame the media, albeit for a different reason. Hello Guys-don't you get any better  scoop than putting up pictures of Taimur and Misha and  Soha's dauther's pictures ( Soha is a bit  low on the pecking order ,so don't remember  her daughter's name)- making them a star out of nothing. While I was 'helping' the 'media' make stars out of those children, kaam waali bai ki  beti came to inform me that her mother was not well and she had come to fill in for her today!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: navy;">Ahh... so much for the stars and the stardusts....</span></p>
